Welcome to 
our Farm on the Web. We're glad you're here.

Way back in 
the late 80's, we decided to do our level best to keep artificial pesticides and 
fertilizers off of our food. Why? Because once upon a time there was a little 
girl who liked to pick cherry tomatoes and eat them while she wandered through 
her garden. Her world was full of fresh tomatoes, 
carrots, English peas, and a squash or two. Her fairy princess friends dined on 
only the sweetest strawberries and drank clear water from pecan shells. Who has 
time to wash strawberries when a bird could descend at any moment?!  It's best 
to just pluck them off and pop them in! We are looking 
forward  to sharing that kind of freshness with you!
